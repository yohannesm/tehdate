# Introduction #
Our third assignment is about a Gregorian Date implementation. The date is given by an epoch starting from the year 1600. Given either a date or a number of days, we must output the correct output through a conversion that gives the correct data.


# Details #
The Gregorian Date will take in a number of days through the constructor and, through O(1) time, assemble a Gregorian date with the epoch starting at 1600. There will be a function that allows days to be built from a date as well. Then there will be date operations that allow for addition and subtraction of dates in both day and date form. There will also be functions that allow for less than and equal to dates to be checked.
